# UltimatePlan
## Application Overview
The main focus of Ultimate Plan is to provide a platform to organize the user’s tasks and is targeted towards individuals who have a busy lifestyle with many tasks and events to keep track of. Ultimate Plan also aims to add a more social component to the creation and attainment of user’s goals by providing a platform where users can share their goals and progress with their friends and family.

## Implementation
This application was built using the MERN stack. The frontend of the development uses React.js and HTML/CSS. There are two design variations of the frontend, with version A located in the client folder and version B in client2. The backend of the application uses MongoDB as the database to store user information and Node.js and Express is used for the REST API server. The backend is planned to be hosted using Heroku*, and both versions of the frontend are hosted on Netlify:
